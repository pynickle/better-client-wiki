# Future Development Plans

## Always Keep Up

I will be adding more features in the future and will **update to new Minecraft versions as quickly as possible after their release**. 

This ensures players on vanilla servers (which typically keep up with Minecraft version updates) can **experience a full range of features at the fastest pace** without anxiously waiting for different mod authors to update their mods.

## Suggestion

If you **have any good suggestions**, feel free to share them on Discord or submit a GitHub issue to let me know! I'll give them serious consideration.

Of course, bug reports are also very welcome!
